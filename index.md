I'm currently working as a full-stack software engineer at [buildo](https://buildo.io)
in Milan, Italy.

Previously, I did a PhD candidate in Computer Science
in a joint doctoral program
between the University of Genoa in Italy (DIBRIS department)
and Paris Diderot University in France (IRIF laboratory),
advised by Giuseppe Castagna, Elena Zucca, and Davide Ancona.
My [research work](/research) concerns type systems for functional programming languages.
