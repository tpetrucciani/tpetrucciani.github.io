Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in Computer Science
in a joint doctoral program
between the University of Genoa in Italy (DIBRIS department)
and Paris Diderot University in France (IRIF laboratory).
I work under the supervision of Giuseppe Castagna, Elena Zucca, and Davide Ancona.
My [research](/research) concerns type systems for functional programming languages.
